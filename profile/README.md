# About us

We are university students studying International Media and Computing and this is our first project together. For some of us it's the first time creating a game, working with Unity, joining a game jam and especially joining GMTK.

## Our first submission: WaveMaker
This game is part of [GMTK Game Jam 2023](https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2023) with the topic "[Roles Reversed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7JhCPhqWTas)". We decided to make a reversed tower defense game inspired by [Kingdom Rush](https://www.kingdomrush.com).
In our game you have to build a wave of diffent mobs (monsters) and send them through a map. A simple script generates towers that try to stop your mobs from reaching the end of the map.&nbsp;</p>
